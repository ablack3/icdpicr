<p>Version 0.1.0
ICDPICR is adapted from the ICDPIC Version 3.0 Stata program. Some of the
functionality of the original program has been reduced in the interest of providing updates for
only the most useful elements of the original ICDPIC program. ICDPICR is
designed to work with both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. ICDPICR is open
source and all code and documentation can be found at
<a href='https://github.com/ablack3/icdpicr'>https://github.com/ablack3/icdpicr</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="description"><a class="anchor" href="#description"></a>Description</h2>

    

<p>ICDPICR is an R package that currently consists of a single function that performs
the same task that the "trauma" program does in the Stata version of ICDPIC.
The intention of these ICDPIC programs
is to provide inexpensive methods for translating International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes into standard injury
categories and/or scores.  Initial development of the ICDPIC Stata programs occurred
as part of research projects funded by the National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control through the Harvard Injury Control Research Center
(CDC R49/CCR 115279) and by the Maine Medical Center Research Strategic
Plan.  The translation of ICDPIC to R was supported by funding from the Maine Medical Center
Division of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care and Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation.
The authors are grateful for this support and would also appreciate
suggestions or corrections from any user of the software. Bug reports or feature requests
may be submitted at <a href='https://github.com/ablack3/icdpicr/issues'>https://github.com/ablack3/icdpicr/issues</a>.
Publications of studies in which these programs or tables are used should cite the authors.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="methods"><a class="anchor" href="#methods"></a>Methods</h2>

    

<p>For each valid ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM injury diagnosis, ICDPIC-R is programmed to generate an approximate AIS
and body region, using the original AIS anatomic classification (as modified by Baker and colleagues) into
six body regions: Head and neck, face, chest, abdomen and pelvic contents, extremities and pelvic bones, and
general.  In addition, each code referring to a mechanism of injury is categorized as recommended or
proposed by the CDC. For each injured person, ICDPIC-R determines the maximal AIS in each body region
and overall, an Injury Severity Score (RISS), and a CDC mechanism category.</p>
<p>Mapping of ICD-9-CM E-codes to CDC mechanism categories simply involved translation of the programming
code from Stata into R, using essentially the same table.  Mapping of ICD-10-CM codes to mechanism categories was
based on a similar table published by the CDC.</p>
<p>The National Trauma Data Standard used by NTDB considers valid ICD-10-CM injury codes to be those in the
ranges S00-S99, T07, T14, T20-T28, and T30-32.  ICDPIC-R recognizes only these codes in the calculation
of injury severity from ICD-10, and also requires that the codes have a decimal point in the fourth position
and the letter "A" in the eighth position (indicating an initial encounter).
Mapping of ICD-10-CM codes to AIS severity is performed in two ways, as described below.</p>
<p><strong>“ROCmax” mapping method for ICD-10-CM codes:</strong>
For each NTDB subject k with 1 to Nk valid ICD-10 codes,
each code was given a score of 0 if the subject survived and a score of 1/Nk
if the subject died (as recorded either in the Emergency Department file or in the Discharge file).
A fractional hospital mortality (HMF) was derived as the average score for each subject with a given
ICD-10 code.  Different cutpoints were investigated to assign each ICD-10 code to an AIS severity
based on HMF.  Body regions were assigned using the proposed CDC classification.
For each combination of cutpoints, the discrimination of the resulting ISS for predicting
mortality was determined using a C-statistic.
Among the combinations resulting in a maximum C-statistic (to two decimal places), the
combination was chosen that most closely approximated the ISS that had been calculated by
hospital trauma registrars (ISSAIS).</p>

<p><strong>"GEM" mapping method for ICD-10-CM codes:</strong>
ICD-10-CM codes are first mapped to ICD-9-CM codes using the General Equivalency Mapping (GEM)
tables provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and then those ICD-9-CM
codes are mapped to AIS using the table inherited from the Stata version of ICDPIC.
The user is given the option to ignore ICD-10-CM codes if desired.  Otherwise, if the GEM maps an
 ICD-10-CM code to two or more ICD-9-CM codes associated with different severities, the user
 is given the option whether to assign the greater or lesser of these severities
 (“GEMmax” or “GEMmin”).  When the GEM maps an ICD-10-CM code to two or more ICD-9-CM codes
 associated with different AIS body regions, the verbal description of the ICD-10-CM code in the
 GEM table is used to assign a body region.</p>
<p>The GEM mapping method is necessary when injuries have been coded with ICD-9-CM codes only,
and may be preferable when they have been coded with a mix of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM.</p>


<p>For any of the ICD-9 or ICD-10 mapping methods in ICDPIC-R, the maximum AIS Severity for each AIS body region
(MXAISBR1 ... MXAISBR6 in the output) is 0 if there are no valid injury codes for that body region.  It is
recorded as “missing” if there are valid codes for that body region, but their severity cannot be determined.
 Otherwise, it is the maximum known severity (1 through 6) for that body region.  Maximum AIS Severity
 (MAXAIS in the output data) is the maximum of (MXAISBR1 ... MXAISBR6); MAXAIS will thus be 0 if there is no
 diagnosis code associated with an AIS severity.</p>
<p>Injury Severity Score (RISS) is calculated according to the classic description of Baker and colleagues,
namely the sum of the squares of the three largest elements of (MXAISBR1 ... MXAISBR6).  The user can choose
whether to assign RISS=75 when any injury is assigned a severity of 6, or to reassign a severity of 5 to
these injuries and calculate RISS as above.  The first option, RISS = 75 when any severity = 6, is the default
in ICDPIC-R, since by definition an AIS severity of 6 should denote an injury that is uniformly fatal and
thus should rarely be found in hospital data.</p>
