Description: This package contains a function for the categorization of injuries using International
    Classification of Diseases ('ICD') codes. Starting with 'ICD-8', 
    methods have been described to map injury diagnosis codes to severity scores, especially the 
    Abbreviated Injury Scale ('AIS') and Injury Severity Score ('ISS'). 'ICDPIC' was originally developed 
    for this purpose using 'Stata', and 'icdpicr' is an open-access update that accepts both 'ICD-9' and 
    'ICD-10' codes. The ideal methods of injury categorization and injury severity scoring involve 
    trained personnel with access to injured persons or their medical records. 'ICDPIC-R' may be a 
    useful substitute when this ideal cannot be obtained.
